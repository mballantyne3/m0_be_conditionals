# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I feel fairly confident with the manipulating the comparison operators to perform a task I wanted, and was, for the most part, able to anticipate the result.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
I actually really liked the logical operators, and felt I was able to add more detail in specifying my comparisons.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
"If statements" actually initially proved slightly tricky for me when having to use them in a live setting and I froze up in how to articulate and fabricate one out of thin air vs one that was already made up.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
I probably spent a grand total of 2 1/2 hours on this segment which is a bit longer than I would have liked. I had to take several breaks in between because I started making silly mistakes and would just hit complete road blocks that permitted me from moving forward.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I need to practice navigating around my gitHub, it took me a bit of time to figure out how to clone my work, and upload it to my own personal repository. I'm hoping that by continually working through these assigned problems, I get more comfortable with the operation.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
At this point in time, I really just have the question of how to view my own version of the repository and see the committed changes I initiated through the terminal.
